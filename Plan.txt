1) Find way to make all basic shape out of triangles.
2) Implement collision detection bwtween all basic shapes using the individual triangles
3) Then figure out how to use the function to make complex pollygons from triangles
3) implement collision for those. Should be simple cuz uses same as other one since all triangles
